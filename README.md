**MultiRFLinkTCPBridge** is a robust Python app that consolidates multiple RFLink streams (433MHz, 868MHz, etc.) from distributed devices into a single TCP output - ready for Home Assistant or any automation hub.

---

## üìå Key Benefit

üîß **Multi-RFLink support out of the box** - Home Assistant supports only one RFLink connection natively. This bridge removes that limitation by allowing multiple RFLink units - each potentially sniffing different RF frequencies like **433MHz** and **868MHz** - to be connected simultaneously.

üõ∞Ô∏è **Extend signal range and coverage** by deploying RFLink devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi Zero W + RF modules) in different rooms or floors. This bridge links all devices into one TCP stream, letting Home Assistant consume everything from a **single, unified endpoint**.

## üß© Features

- Supports 433MHz and 868MHz RFLinks in parallel
- Centralizes multiple RFLink TCP feeds into one
- Compatible with Home Assistant, Node-RED, MQTT, etc.
- Optional Telegram alerts on disconnect/reconnect
- Graceful handling of stale messages on client connection
- Lightweight and efficient (runs on Pi Zero W)

## üöÄ Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mortylabs/MultiRFLinkTCPBridge.git
cd MultiRFLinkTCPBridge
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # configure IPs, ports, and logging
pip install -r requirements.txt
python MultiRFLinkTCPBridge.py
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create and customize a `.env` file in the project root. You can copy from a template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable                 | Description                                           | Example             |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `RFLINK1_IP`, `PORT`     | RFLink device #1 IP and port                          | `192.168.1.10:5000` |
| `RFLINK2_IP`, `PORT`     | Optional second RFLink device                         | `192.168.1.11:5001` |
| `RFLINK3_IP`, `PORT`     | Optional third RFLink device                          | `192.168.1.12:5002` |
| `RFLINK_BRIDGE_IP`       | IP for this bridge to listen on                       | `0.0.0.0`           |
| `RFLINK_BRIDGE_PORT`     | Port for unified stream                               | `1234`              |
| `WRITE_LOG_TO_DISK`      | Write logs to file (`true` or `false`)                | `true`              |
| `LOGGING_LEVEL`          | Logging level (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`)_     | `INFO`              |
| `TELEGRAM_ENABLED`       | Enable Telegram alerts                                | `true`              |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_KEY`       | Telegram bot token                                    | `-`                 |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_CHAT_ID`   | Target chat ID for alerts                             | `-`                 |


## üß† Usage

Once configured, simply run the script:

```bash
python MultiRFLinkTCPBridge.py
```
- Starts listener threads for each RFLink
- Forwards their messages into one bridge stream
- Supports reconnects and alerting via Telegram
- Messages drained on new client connect to avoid stale payloads

This bridge gives your automation system a unified, real-time view of your RF environment, regardless of how many RFLinks you deploy or where you place them.

## üè† Integration Examples

### üîå Home Assistant

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: tcp
    host: 192.168.1.50  # IP of your bridge device
    port: 1234          # Port defined in your .env
    name: RFLink Stream

```
### üîÅ Node-RED Integration

To integrate the unified RFLink stream into Node-RED:

1. **Add a TCP In node**
   - Type: `stream`
   - Host: IP of your MultiRFLinkTCPBridge (e.g., `192.168.1.50`)
   - Port: TCP port from your `.env` (e.g., `1234`)

2. **Connect it to a debug or processing node**
   - This will show raw RFLink messages from all linked devices

üí° Tip: You can split or parse the RFLink strings using `function`


## üìà Roadmap

- [x] Multi-RFLink support across IPs and ports
- [x] Support for multiple frequencies (433MHz and 868MHz)
- [x] Telegram alert integration for error/reconnects
- [x] Graceful queue draining on new client connect
- [ ] Dockerfile and container support
- [ ] AsyncIO-based socket backend for better scalability
